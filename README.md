# web3.storage in the browser from a CDN

<!-- A demo using the [`web3.storage`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3.storage) client in the browser to pre-calculate the CID for an asset then store it on web3.storage. -->

Content addressing, IPFS, Filecoin, web3storage... it's all pretty rad! Here is gateway URL for the Content ID of this example, (stored via Teller.storage of course!) so you can check it out in your browser! https://ipfs.io/ipfs/

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in your favourite browser and add your files ðŸš€. 

You need an API token, which you can get by signing in to web3.storage, and clicking "Create an API token"
